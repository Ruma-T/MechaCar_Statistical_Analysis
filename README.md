# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

### Purpose
•	We have to analysis the production data with our knowledge of R to help the MechaCar’s manufacturing team to improve the production. Two data set has to be compared  to perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
•	We’ll also make a summary of statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
•	We’ll be running t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.

### Result

Mechacar file is read and An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables.
 r-squared value. In this case, it is at 0.7149 mean that out of 100 instances, this model would approximately predict the mpg of the MechaCar correctly 71 times. This means that the model would be considered effective.
